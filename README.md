## Fine-Tuning BERT for Sentiment Analysis

This project demonstrates fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model for sentiment analysis. Using the IMDB dataset, fine-tune BERT to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. Fine-tuning allows us to adapt a pre-trained model to specific tasks by leveraging its pre-learned knowledge and adjusting it based on task-specific data.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model to perform binary sentiment classification on movie reviews from the IMDB dataset.

## Key components of the project include:
- **BERT Model**: A transformer-based model pre-trained on a large corpus of text, fine-tuned for sentiment classification.
- **IMDB Dataset**: A dataset of movie reviews used for training and testing the model.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Classifying reviews as either "positive" or "negative".

## Features
- **Pre-trained BERT Model**: Fine-tuned on the IMDB dataset for sentiment analysis.
- **Tokenization and Padding**: Text data is tokenized and padded to ensure compatibility with BERT input requirements.
- **Sentiment Prediction**: Model predicts whether a movie review is positive or negative.
- **Model Saving and Loading**: Fine-tuned model and tokenizer are saved for future use.
